## Learning objectives

- [ ] Knowing about ORM and (`mongoose` as) ODM
- [ ] Understanding how to write a `mongoose` Schema
- [ ] Knowing how to connect an application with a (local) database using `mongoose`
- [ ] Knowing how to read data with a `mongoose` model
- [ ] Understanding that the applications currently do not work if deployed to Vercel due to local
      databases

---

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> 💡 Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

Using `mongoose`, we can easily access our database from our application and make sure that the data has the correct data types we have defined.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

A non-relational database like MongoDB can quickly become messy because you can add fields and data types to every document as you wish. By using `mongoose`, we can make sure that the data types are coherent and don't break our application.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

How can we read data from our database and display it in the frontend?

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

- Next.js
- Backend Basics
- Backend API Routes
- Backend MongoDB (with MongoDB Compass)

### ORM / ODM and `mongoose`

- [ ] Remind students that right now, we know how to set up a (local) database using MongoDB Compass.
- [ ] Show the Demo: it has an overview and details page, but receives the data from `lib/data.js`, i.e. there is no database where we could create / read / update / delete entries.
- [ ] Announce the goal of the session: we want to have a database with the jokes' data and access it from our app.
- [ ] Explain that we need a JavaScript API to work with MongoDB
  - [ ] that is sometimes called a database driver (just like your printer driver);
  - [ ] we will use a library called `mongoose`. That's an ODM (Object Document Mapper).
- [ ] Explain [the terms ORM / ODM](https://medium.com/spidernitt/orm-and-odm-a-brief-introduction-369046ec57eb):

  - [ ] ORM (_Object Relation Mapping_):
    - [ ] technique to perform CRUD to mainly relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.),
    - [ ] uses an _object-oriented paradigm_
    - [ ] like excel spreadsheet with rows and columns => you cannot add a field to one entry that doesn't exist for all
    - [ ] is mapped to a single object for all entries.
  - [ ] ODM (_Object Document Mapping_):

    - [ ] like ORM for non-relational databases (MongoDB)
    - [ ] uses a _document-oriented paradigm_

- [ ] Summarize the reasons to use `mongoose` as ORM:
  - [ ] It helps building a schema and querying the database (it's also our db driver).
  - [ ] It has to run on the server, because database access is not secure in the browser.
- [ ] Remind students that we already have a server: our Next.js API routes! 🤡

### Prepare and Connect the Database

- [ ] Explain that we need to set up two things:
  - [ ] a (local) database with all jokes and
  - [ ] the connection between this database and the Next.js app with `mongoose`.
- [ ] To start with the database, open MongoDB Compass and if you not have done so in the _Backend
      MongoDB_ session, create

  - [ ] a database called _jokes-database_ and
  - [ ] a collection called _jokes_;
  - [ ] [import the jokes data](assets/data.json) into your _jokes_ collection via _Import File_ (or
        copy the content and paste it into _Insert Document_).

- [ ] Explain that we still need the connection between database and app:
  - [ ] Install mongoose: `npm install mongoose`.
  - [ ] Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project with the following content:
        `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jokes-database`.
  - [ ] Create a `db/connect.js` file and copy the
        [content from the Next.js mongoose example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-mongodb-mongoose/lib/dbConnect.js).
  - [ ] Remind students that it's not necessary to understand this file entirely:
    - [ ] Note that it uses the `MONGODB_URI` we have just set up in `.env.local` to create a
          connection.
    - [ ] You should leave it here, but if there are any further questions:
      - [ ] The example uses a cached connection across hot reloads in development to prevent
            multiple connections to be opened simultaneously.
      - [ ] It exposes a function that returns the connection (wrapped in a promise).

### Writing a Schema

- [ ] Explain that we need to declare a
      [Schema that describes the data type of the documents in a collection](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html).
- [ ] We use this Schema to create a Model that we can use to interact with the database.
- [ ] Note the difference between _Schema_ and _Model_
  - [ ] the _Schema_ describes the structure of a document
  - [ ] the _model_ gives us a programming interface for interacting with the database.
- [ ] Create `db/models/Joke.js`:
  - [ ] We don't need to define the `id` because `mongoose` will automatically create one.
  - [ ] The name of the collection the model works upon is being generated from the models name, in
        this case "Joke" => "jokes".
  - [ ] You can call the `mongoose.model` method with a third argument that holds the collection
        name.
  - [ ] We have to check whether the model with the name "Joke" has already been compiled and if
        yes, take the already compiled model. That's why we use the logical OR (`||`) operator.

```js
// db/models/Joke.js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const { Schema } = mongoose;

const jokeSchema = new Schema({
  joke: { type: String, required: true },
});

const Joke = mongoose.models.Joke || mongoose.model("Joke", jokeSchema);

export default Joke;
```

### Querying the Database with `mongoose`

#### Query all Jokes

- [ ] Explain that we can use the created `mongoose` model to query our database.
- [ ] Switch to `api/jokes/index.js`.
- [ ] Explain that we don't want to use the local `lib/data.js` anymore, but our local database;
      delete the import.
- [ ] Instead, import `dbConnect` and the `Joke` model.
- [ ] Explain that we want to create a connection to our database first by calling
      `await dbConnect()` inside of the request handler function.

  - [ ] Note that we need to make the `handler` an async function now.

- [ ] Explain that we can define different behaviors depending on the HTTP request method used;
      because we have not declared anything else in `components/JokeList/index.js`, the default is a
      `GET` request.
- [ ] Write the code to check the `request.method` and if it's `GET`,
  - [ ] use the imported `Joke` model and it's `.find()` method to find all jokes in the database;
  - [ ] remind students that we have to `await` the response again,
  - [ ] return a `200` status and the `jokes`.

```js
// api/jokes/index.js
import dbConnect from "../../../db/connect";
import Joke from "../../../db/models/Joke";

export default async function handler(request, response) {
  await dbConnect();

  if (request.method === "GET") {
    const jokes = await Joke.find();
    return response.status(200).json(jokes);
  }
}
```

#### Query one Joke by Id

- [ ] Note that querying a single joke from the database does not work yet.
- [ ] Switch to `api/jokes/[id].js`.
- [ ] As above, delete the import of `jokes` from `lib/data.js`.
- [ ] Import `dbConnect` and the `Joke` model.
- [ ] Make the `handler` function `async` and `await dbConnect()`.
- [ ] Check for the `request.method === "GET"`.
- [ ] Explain that `.findById(id)` is a useful (almost) equivalent to `.findOne({ _id: id})`.

```js
// api/jokes/[id].js
import dbConnect from "../../../db/connect";
import Joke from "../../../db/models/Joke";

export default async function handler(request, response) {
  await dbConnect();
  const { id } = request.query;

  if (request.method === "GET") {
    const joke = await Joke.findById(id);

    if (!joke) {
      return response.status(404).json({ status: "Not Found" });
    }

    response.status(200).json(joke);
  }
}
```

- [ ] Explain that we need to adapt the frontend slightly to make the links to the details pages
      work:
  - [ ] the fetched `data` array now contains objects with `_id` instead of `id`.

```js
// necessary frontend changes in components/JokeList.js: change joke.id to joke._id
<li key={joke._id}>
  <button type="button" onClick={() => router.push(`/${joke._id}`)}>
    {joke.joke}
  </button>
</li>
```

- [ ] Explain that the Next.js application will no longer work when deployed to Vercel.
  - [ ] The application needs to connect to a database which is currently only on our local
        computer - which is not reachable from Vercel (from the internet).
  - [ ] We will solve this issue soon with the session about "MongoDB Atlas".

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](backend-read.md) and the [challenges](challenges-backend-read.md) to the
      students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> 💡 In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

ORM/ODM, mongoose, schema, model

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.
